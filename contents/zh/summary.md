前端开发的技术进步很快. 前端开发者的重要职责之一
是了解最新推出的工具, 最新的潮流以及开发流程.
The web is a rapidly evolving universe. An important part of our job as front-end developers is keeping up to date and staying close to new tools, trends and workflows.

每天都有成千上百的前端文章发布出来, 你不可能把他们全读了.
我们认为你应该用聪明的方法来跟上最新的方向, 因此我们创建了这个"食谱"
Hundreds of blog posts and articles are published every day, but there is no way you can read all of them. We think you should have a strategy to keep up to date, so we have created this recipe.
